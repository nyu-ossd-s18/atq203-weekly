## [Progress](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/jupyter-milestones/projects/1) on Jupyter Notebook

This week, we found [this](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3521) issue to work on as a team. I started to work on adding the file size to the model [here](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/notebook/commit/3650cc7cb41b2c52b55875922003a6eb604f61fc) and also implemented the sorting function [here](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/notebook/commit/388d6367caa8aca4c13751b7bc752bedc0a64b97).

I also helped with improving documentation to fix [this issue](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3396), by making [this PR](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/pull/332) to document how to open a specific Notebook.
