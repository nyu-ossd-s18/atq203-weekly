## Team Assesment and Plan

We choose [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook) as the open source project to work on for the rest of this semester â€“ it's a "web-based notebook environment for interactive computing".

The front-end is written in JavaScript, and back-end mostly in Python, both which all four of us are fairly familiar with, so in terms of understanding how Jupyter works, we don't have to learn a new language to figure it out, which is a plus!

A possible challenge I personally have is understanding kernel-level stuff that Jupyter deals with, as that's something that I haven't had much experience or exposure with, so I'm trying to learn as much as I can from the source code and the community.

We decided to meet every **Tuesday at 6.30pm.**

## Milestones

- Looking through the issues and contribute / comment of them if relevant
- Open issues regarding documentation if we feel like there isn't enough documentation
- Start looking for non-technical issues that we can work on
- Ask to work on non-technical issues and submit a pull request
- Review pull requests, and raise any concerns or request any clarifications if relevant
- Start looking for small technical issues we can solve

## Setting up Team Repositories

We created our [project team](https://github.com/orgs/nyu-ossd-s18/teams/jupyter) within the organization and forked the Jupyter Notebook project [here](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/notebook). We also created another [team repository](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/jupyter-milestones/) to coordinate work on the project, using the [kanban project board](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/jupyter-milestones/projects/1).

## Weekly Contributions

I started watching the Jupyter Notebook repository after our team decided that that was the project we were going to be focusing on and got emails when certain issues were updated / being commented on.

I found this [issue](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/2707) that seemed straightforward and asked if I could work on it. At first I thought it was going to be a simple CSS change, but then I realized that many of the UI components were created in Javascript and there were a few abstractions that required some digging / experimenting around. Implementing this feature took longer than I expected haha. Made [this](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/3386) pull request at night and it got merged the next morning (whoa! fast!)

Found another bug on the the [OSSD site](joannakl.github.io/cs480_s18/) and opened [this issue](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/93).
