## Code Triage

I was looking for GitHub Classroom's repo on CodeTriage but realized that it wasn't there so I submitted it to be triaged [here](https://www.codetriage.com/education/classroom). I find Classroom to be a good project to start of with in open source contribution because we use it in many CS classes to manage our assignments, and it's written in Ruby, which is a very user-friendly language.

The [pull request](https://github.com/education/classroom/pull/1245) I reviewed was a feature to allow teachers to download classroom rosters. My review dealt more with code legibility than functionality â€“ this PR had many comments from the [HoundCI](https://houndci.com/) bot and I suggested ways to make this method look cleaner by using the Ruby `.try()` method to remove some of the conditional statements.

Specific comment links: [here](https://github.com/education/classroom/pull/1245#pullrequestreview-91988297) and [here](https://github.com/education/classroom/pull/1245#pullrequestreview-92037832).

**Before**

```ruby
def self.to_csv
  roster_array = []
  CSV.generate(headers: true, col_sep: ",", force_quotes: true) do |csv|
    csv << %i[identifier github_username name]

    all.sort_by(&:identifier).each do |entry|
      name  = ""
      login = entry.user ? entry.user.github_user.login : ""
      name  = entry.user.github_user.name ? entry.user.github_user.name : "" if entry.user

      roster_array << [entry.identifier, login, name]
    end
    roster_array.map { |e| csv << e }
  end
end
```
**After**
```ruby
def self.to_csv
  CSV.generate(headers: true, col_sep: ",", force_quotes: true) do |csv|
    csv << %i[identifier github_username name]

    all.sort_by(&:identifier).each do |entry|
      github_user = entry.user.try(:github_user)
      login = github_user.try(:login) || ""
      name = github_user.try(:name) || ""
      csv << [entry.identifier, login, name]
    end
  end
end

It's nice to know that my comments helped [Kadaaran](https://github.com/Kadaaran), who worked on this PR ðŸŽ‰
