## [Progress](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/jupyter-milestones/projects/1) on Jupyter Notebook
I worked with Celina on this [PR](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/3539) to add the file size to the views, and made some changes according to the maintainers feedback â€“ including using an external humanize module to parse the file size, fixing some security concerns and view isses, and adding the license for the external module.
