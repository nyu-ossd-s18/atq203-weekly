### Steps to submitting a Pull Request (from Week 4)

I made [this PR](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/pull/86) that fixes [this issue](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/76). First, I forked `github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18` to `https://github.com/ashleytqy/cs480_s18` using the GitHub UI (the fork button).

```
git clone https://github.com/ashleytqy/cs480_s18
git checkout -b ash.add-readme
```

Then I added instructions in `README.md`

```
git add README.md
git commit -m "add instructions in README"
git push
```

I realized that I wanted to make more changes, so I did and repeated the above steps with a different commit message.

I then navigated to `https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/` and made a pull request from `ashleytqy:ash.add-readme` into `joannakl:gh-page`, adding relevant comments and tagging the person who reported the issue for comments.

### What type of things are you looking for when you select an open source project to work on?

I'm looking out for an active open source project – one with recent activity by the maintainers and contributors, be it reviewing pull requests, commenting on issues or clarifying use cases for feature requests.

I'm also looking for a project that is written in a language that I'm familiar with – either Ruby, Javascript, Python or Java, and have approaching issues or bugs to fix. I'd like to work on something that I've used before / am using, or find useful, so that I can be invested in contributing to the project.

### What are you able to offer to the team that you will be working on for the project?

I think I can navigate a code base fairly well, i.e. know which folder to look for certain pieces of code, and I can also contribute to non-technical aspects of a project (adding or editing documentation). I can also try to help out with the setting up of dev environments because I've done that a few times, but have always encountered errors so there was a lot of frustration and trial and errors before I actually got the projects up.

### What are you hoping to learn from working on an open source project?

I hope to learn how to interact with the project contributors and maintainers, how to ask the right questions when I encounter a problem. Being involved in an open source project would also give me a clearer picture of how the open source ecosystem works – how issues are assigned and fixed, which pull requests get merged, and if they don't, why they aren't accepted.

### What are you most worried about when you are thinking about and planning to work on an open source project? 

My biggest worry is that I don't understand the source code, and can't properly set up a development environment to be able to even start fixing issues.

# Contributions Summary

### Course contributions
- Made [this PR](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/pull/86) to add improve our `README.md` with setup and build instructions
- Commented on [this PR](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/pull/84) when I noticed that `.DS_Store` was committed
- Opened [this issues](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/77) because I realised that we didn't have a `CONTRIBUTING.md` when most open source projects we looked at did.


### External contributions
- Working on [this PR](https://github.com/Mailtrain-org/mailtrain/pull/377) for Mailtrain to allow CORS headers to set in their API routes
- Worked on [this PR](https://github.com/education/classroom/pull/1283) for GitHub Classrooms to sort assignments. It's a simple fix, but the TravisCI builds are failing and I don't know what to do
