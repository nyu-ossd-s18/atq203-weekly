## Humanitarian aspects of the projects I contribute to

Projects that I'm vaguely familiar with that can be considered humanitarian would be **OpenStreetMap**. According to [their website](https://www.hotosm.org), they make their data public for "humanitarian response and economic development".

For example, a recent project that maps healthcare data in Tanzania can help "government bodies better understand maternal health needs based on current access to facilities". This data then becomes the evidence for the government to take action to build better healthcare facilities in the areas that need the most, or improve transport links and city infrastructure to increase access to health facilities further away, thus impacting the lives of the people there.

## [Progress our group made](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/jupyter-milestones/projects/1)

We added the milestones that we wanted to achieve by the end of the semester. So far, we've made sure that we had the development environment installed, and we now have a Google Docs to document meetings. We also looked through potential issues to work on as a team during class on Tuesday, but many of those issues seemed either too difficult, or were installation / OS-specific problems. 

## Next thing I will be working on
I'll be working on going through the issues that seem doable, and trying to work on them.
