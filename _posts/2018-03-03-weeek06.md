## Setting up Team Repositories

We created our [project team](https://github.com/orgs/nyu-ossd-s18/teams/jupyter) within the organization and forked the Jupyter Notebook project [here](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/notebook). We also created another [team repository](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/jupyter-milestones/) to coordinate work on the project, using the [kanban project board](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/jupyter-milestones/projects/1).


## Weekly Contributions

I started watching the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook) repository after our team decided that that was the project we were going to be focusing on and got emails when certain issues were updated / being commented on.

I found this [issue](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/2707) that seemed straightforward and asked if I could work on it. At first I thought it was going to be a simple CSS change, but then I realized that many of the UI components were created in Javascript and there were a few abstractions that required some digging / experimenting around. Implementing this feature took longer than I expected haha. Made [this](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/3386) pull request at night and it got merged the next morning (whoa! fast!)

Found another bug on the the [OSSD site](joannakl.github.io/cs480_s18/) and opened [this issue](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/93).
