## Open Data Week Events

I went for one ODW event on Tuesday.

The other one I wanted to go to got postponed due to the snow.

## Weekly Contributions

* Made [this pull request](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/pull/491) to Docusaurus to update their CircleCI documentation. Even though this PR was a non-code change, I had to make sure that the sample config file included in the docs were correct, so I had to create a test repository with that config file and integrate it with CircleCI to make sure it ran. After 17 failues, I finally got the right configurations. Joel (the co-creator) was super fast in responding to issues and pull request. He gave me some good suggestions and I revised my PR based on that.

* Made [this pull request](https://github.com/ml5js/ml5js.github.io/pull/9) to enable search on the ML5.js documentation site. Getting the API key took a bit of reading the Algolia docs, and the Docusaurus docs, to find out how I can get the key and index name without having to pay for it. Turns out you just need to fill [this form](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/) and an Algolia engineer would reach out to you.

* Made [this pull request](https://github.com/ml5js/ml5js.github.io/pull/12) to update broken links on the ML5.js documentation site.

TIL: non-code changes occasionally involve writing some code even if it doesn't end up in the final PR.
