## Wikipedia Contributions

I made two contributions over the week â€“ the first was an article of my [high school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanyang_Girls%27_High_School), and the second was an article on [Singlish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singlish).

I started off going through articles in [this list of articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_copy_edit) that Wikipedia deems need to be copy edited. I read through some of them, keeping an eye out for grammatical and spelling errors but they looked okay.

Then I started looking up articles on the topics I knew, and the relatively less popular one. I read articles about my hometown, local literature, food and culture, our pidgin language, my high school and many others.

In the end I made two different contributions:
* The [first contribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nanyang_Girls%27_High_School&diff=prev&oldid=824898512) was an addition of an example a joint activity my high school held with our partner school

* The [second](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Singlish&diff=prev&oldid=824899315) was more of a formatting edit, to make it consistent with how examples were formatting elsewhere in the article on Singlish.
