## [Progress](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/jupyter-milestones/projects/1) on Jupyter Notebook 

As a group, we successfully found issues we want to work on and are starting to work on. Celina and Rosa are working on this [issue](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/2337), and Dana is working on [this](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/2460). We haven't found an issue that all four of us can work on together though.

Personally, I worked on this [issue](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3251) to disable cache-controls so that the downloaded file would be the most updated one. I tried to reproduce the issue locally (because I've never downloaded a file from Jupyter before) and managed to do so after a few tries.

At first, we thought it was an issue with the ETags. I read up about it [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag) and [here](https://gist.github.com/6a68/4971859), which was pretty cool cos I didn't know it existed as a caching validator.

When I started to implement the fix, I dug through the [Tornado Web Server](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/) source code to figure out what was actually [happening](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/_modules/tornado/web.html#RequestHandler.finish) behind the scene when `RequestHandler.finish()` was called, and realised that the ETag was set within that method, so ETags weren't the problem.

In the end, the fix was fairly simple, to add a `Cache-Control` header, so I submitted a [PR](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/3484) for that.

I also created an [issue](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3471) to improve Jupyter's web accessibility, which Celina is working on.

I'm planning to work on this other [issue](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3292), which I've asked for clarification and am starting to play around with [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.com).

## Questions for Danna
* Do you get to choose to work on open source when you joined Google â€“ is this something you specificaly asked for, or was assigned? / Do you get to choose on which open source projects to work on?

* How do you keep contributors outside of Google in the loop and ensure that they have a fair say into the long term trajectory of the project (do they?)?

* Is it easy for you to move from open source to non-open source work internally, and vice-versa? How different is it to work on open source vs non-open source work (e.g. how are KPIs / progress measured)?
